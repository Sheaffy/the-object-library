# the-object-library

## philosophy -
The concept is relativly simple, a library of classes that represent real world objects. these classes can be the backbone behind frameworks or projects, be it online ordering, user accounts, addresses, games, simulations etc. Every class should be if possible written in every language, so as to allow cross combatability between all instances where these classes could be used. No longer will we have to write importer scripts to import user data from one system to the other, if everyone uses these classes as the backbone, it should facilitate easier data transfer.

I am still fleshing out how this will actually represent itself, for example how to we represent a person, should they be human, or person? I ask this question because a human is technically part of the animal kingdom, and can easily extend off animal type classes. in a human can hold charactoristics which differenciate one from another. a person can have a name, gender etc.
